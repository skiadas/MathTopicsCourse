## 2.2

- What is the *Traveling Salesman Problem*? What kinds of graphs does it refer to?
- Think of some personal experience situations that you might represent as traveling salesman problems.
- What are some of the things that might be represented by "cost" in a TSP?

## 2.3

- Describe how the *Nearest-Neighbor Algorithm* works for the TSP.
- Demonstrate what results the Nearest-Neighbor Algorithm produces in some concrete examples.
- the NNA is an example of a *greedy algorithm*. Explain what this term refers to.
- Does NNA always produce the optimal route?
- Does the starting vertex matter for the NNA? Or do we always end up with the same circuit?
- Describe the *Sorted-Edges Algorithm* for the TSP.
- Demonstrate what results the Sorted-Edges Algorithm produces in some concrete examples.
- Does the Sorted-Edges Algorithm always produce the optimal route?
