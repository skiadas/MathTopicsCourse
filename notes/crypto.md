## 17.4

- What is *encryption*?
- What are some uses of cryptography in our world?
- Describe the *Caesar cipher*, then use it to encrypt the message "HANOVERCOLLEGE".
- How would we decrypt a message encrypted via the Caesar cipher?
- If we associate the numbers 0 through 25 to the letters A through Z, how can we mathematically represent the Caesar cipher?
- Describe the *Decimation Cipher*, and use it, with multiplier *5*, to encrypt the message "HANOVERCOLLEGE".
- How does a *linear cipher* work? How are the Decimation and Caesar cipher special cases of it?
- Describe the *Vigenere cipher*, and use it with keyword MATH to encrypt the message "HANOVERCOLLEGE".
- How do we *add* binary strings? What happens if we add the same string twice?
- Read carefully through the "Public Key Cryptography" section and describe the process, and what problem it solves.
