## 4.1

- What is *linear programming* in very general terms?
- What is a *mixture problem*?
- What is an *optional production policy* in a mixture problem?
- A mixture problem contains some key features: *resources*, *products*, *recipes*, *profits* and *objective*. Describe what each of these terms means, and illustrate these terms in a concrete examples.
- Come up with examples of mixture problems from your experience.
- When we translate a mixture problem into an actual mathematical problem, two key steps is the determination of *minimum constraints* and *resource constraints*. Explain what those are. What kinds of algebraic expressions do these give rise to?
- What do we refer to as the *feasible region* in a mixture problem.
- How do we draw the feasible region?

## 4.2

- What does the *corner point principle* say for mixture problems?
- What simple method for determining the optimal production policy does this corner point principle provide?
- What shape does the feasible region have?
- Make sure to review the section about how to solve systems of equations (page 128).
- Work out some examples of solving mixture problems via this principle.
- If a problem has two resources and 3 resource constraints on them, how many corners might the feasible region have?

## 4.3

- What is the *profit line* for a particular profit value? What is its significance when compared to the feasible region?
- How does the profit line help "prove" that the corner point principle works?
