## 2.1

- What circuit do we call a *Hamiltonian Circuit*?
- How do Hamiltonian Circuits differ from Euler Circuits?
- Do all graphs have Hamiltonian Circuits?
- Draw examples of graphs that have a HC but not a EC, as well as graphs that have a EC but not a HC.
- How many edges can we have in a Hamiltonian Circuit, in relation to the number of vertices in the graph?
- Examine the examples in Figure 2.2. How do we know for sure that these examples cannot have a Hamiltonian Circuit?
- The graph on Figure 2.2b shows an example of a graph with a "valid-2-coloring": Each vertex is colored by one of two colors, in such a way that for every edge the two vertices corresponding to it have different colors.
    - Show how the graph on figure 2.1a can also be valid-2-colored.
    - When we can valid-2-color a graph, what condition would preclude such a graph from having a Hamiltonian Circuit?
    - Can you provide examples of graphs that cannot possibly be valid-2-colored?
    - Can you provide examples of graphs that cannot possibly be valid-3-colored?
- What graphs do we call *complete graphs*?
- Do complete graphs always have Hamiltonian Circuits?
- Do complete graphs always have Euler Circuits?
- If we add weights to each edge, what would be a *minimum-cost Hamiltonian Circuit*, and what would be a straightforward algorithm for finding such a circuit?
- What does the *fundamental principle of counting* say? What are some examples where we can apply it?
- In a complete graph on 5 vertices, how many different paths would the "method of trees" end up with?
- When applying the method of trees to find the minimum-cost Hamiltonian Circuit, we get multiple paths in the tree with the same cost. Why is that?
