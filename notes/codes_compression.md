## 17.3

- What is the main goal of *data compression*? What are some examples?
- Data compression requires *variable-length codes*. Explain what that is.
- Table 17.9 shows the relative frequencies of letters in the English language. Morse Code, which is a variable-length code, would likely try to assign shorter codes to most frequent letters. Verify this by looking at the Morse Code assignments in spotlight 17.4 (For example, E takes a single more signal, a dot, and T takes a single signal, a dash, and this matches the fact that E and T are the two most frequent letters).
- Describe what *delta encodings* are, and situations in which they might be effective.
- Describe how the *Huffman encoding* works. How is the code-tree built?
- Show how to encode and decode using the code-tree.
- Using the frequencies in Figure 17.9, construct a Huffman code for the English language. Then use that code to encode the phrase "HANOVERCOLLEGE".
