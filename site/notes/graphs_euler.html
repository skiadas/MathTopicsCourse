<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<h3 id="section">1.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is a <em>graph</em>? What are the vertices and edges in a graph?</li>
<li>Give examples of graphs with 4 vertices and 4 edges.</li>
<li>Provide at least 3 different examples of real-world scenarios from your experience that you might model using a graph.</li>
<li>What is a <em>path</em> in a graph? What is a <em>circuit</em>?</li>
<li>Could we have two distinct edges that both connect the same two vertices?</li>
<li>Could we have a vertex that is not connected to any other vertex?</li>
<li>Could we have an edge that does not connect two vertices?</li>
<li>What circuits do we call <em>Euler circuits</em>?</li>
<li>Why are we interested in Euler circuits?</li>
<li>What did you find most interesting about Leonhard Euler?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-1">1.2</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the two key questions we would want to ask about Euler circuits? How do they differ?</li>
<li>What is the <em>valence</em> of a vertex?</li>
<li>Can two vertices have the same valence?</li>
<li>Can two vertices have different valences?</li>
<li>Can a vertex have a valence of 0? What would that mean for it?</li>
<li>Observe that every edge in a graph contributes 1 point each to two vertices’ valences. With that in mind, what can we say about the sum of all the valences in relation to the number of edges?</li>
<li>Why can’t we have a graph that has exactly one odd valence?</li>
<li>When do we say that a graph is <em>connected</em>?</li>
<li>If all the valences in a graph are positive, why does that not mean that the graph is connected? Provide an example.</li>
<li>What does the <em>Euler Circuit Theorem</em> say?</li>
<li>Demonstrate the ECT in some examples.</li>
<li>Intuitively, why does it make sense that a graph that is not connected cannot have an EC?</li>
<li>Intuitively, why does it make sense that a graph that has an odd valence cannot have an EC?</li>
<li>What is the key guiding principle to keep in mind when trying to find an Euler Circuit in a systematic way?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-2">1.3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Describe the <em>Chinese Postman Problem</em>. What are some real-world examples where it might come up?</li>
<li>What does <em>eulerizing a graph</em> mean?</li>
<li>Can we add any kinds of edges when we are trying to “eulerize” a graph? Explain.</li>
<li>In <em>rectangular networks</em> what systematic method can we follow to eulerize them?</li>
</ul>
