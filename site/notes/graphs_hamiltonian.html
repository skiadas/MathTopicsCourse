<h2 id="section">2.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>What circuit do we call a <em>Hamiltonian Circuit</em>?</li>
<li>How do Hamiltonian Circuits differ from Euler Circuits?</li>
<li>Do all graphs have Hamiltonian Circuits?</li>
<li>Draw examples of graphs that have a HC but not a EC, as well as graphs that have a EC but not a HC.</li>
<li>How many edges can we have in a Hamiltonian Circuit, in relation to the number of vertices in the graph?</li>
<li>Examine the examples in Figure 2.2. How do we know for sure that these examples cannot have a Hamiltonian Circuit?</li>
<li>The graph on Figure 2.2b shows an example of a graph with a “valid-2-coloring”: Each vertex is colored by one of two colors, in such a way that for every edge the two vertices corresponding to it have different colors.
<ul>
<li>Show how the graph on figure 2.1a can also be valid-2-colored.</li>
<li>When we can valid-2-color a graph, what condition would preclude such a graph from having a Hamiltonian Circuit?</li>
<li>Can you provide examples of graphs that cannot possibly be valid-2-colored?</li>
<li>Can you provide examples of graphs that cannot possibly be valid-3-colored?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What graphs do we call <em>complete graphs</em>?</li>
<li>Do complete graphs always have Hamiltonian Circuits?</li>
<li>Do complete graphs always have Euler Circuits?</li>
<li>If we add weights to each edge, what would be a <em>minimum-cost Hamiltonian Circuit</em>, and what would be a straightforward algorithm for finding such a circuit?</li>
<li>What does the <em>fundamental principle of counting</em> say? What are some examples where we can apply it?</li>
<li>In a complete graph on 5 vertices, how many different paths would the “method of trees” end up with?</li>
<li>When applying the method of trees to find the minimum-cost Hamiltonian Circuit, we get multiple paths in the tree with the same cost. Why is that?</li>
</ul>
