<ul>
<li>How does <em>plurality voting</em> work?</li>
<li>Does it always produce at least one winner?</li>
<li>Does it always produce only one winner?</li>
<li>What does the <em>Condorcet Winning Criterion</em> (CWC) say?</li>
<li>So far we have seen the following systems: Imposed Rule, Dictatorship, Plurality, Condorcet’s Winning Method. Which of these, if any, satisfy the Condorcet Winning Criterion? Give concrete examples if they fail to satisfy it.</li>
<li>How does the <em>Borda Count</em> system work?</li>
<li>Does the Borda Count always produce at least one winner?</li>
<li>Does the Borda Count produce at most one winner?</li>
<li>Does the Borda Count satisfy the Condorcet Winning Criterion?</li>
<li>What does the <em>Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives</em> (IIA) property say?</li>
<li>So far we have seen the following systems: Imposed Rule, Dictatorship, Plurality, Condorcet’s Winning Method, Borda Count. Which of these, if any, satisfy the IIA property? Give concrete examples if they fail to satisfy it.</li>
<li>How does <em>Sequential Pairwise Voting</em> work?</li>
<li>Does Sequential Pairwise Voting always produce at least one winner?</li>
<li>Does Sequential Pairwise Voting produce at most one winner?</li>
<li>Does Sequential Pairwise Voting satisfy the CWC and/or IIA properties?</li>
<li>What does the <em>Pareto Condition</em> say?</li>
<li>So far we have seen the following systems: Imposed Rule, Dictatorship, Plurality, Condorcet’s Winning Method, Borda Count, Sequential Pairwise Voting. Which of these, if any, satisfy the Pareto property? Give concrete examples if they fail to satisfy it.</li>

<li>Does the Hare System always produce at least one winner?</li>
<li>Does the Hare System produce at most one winner?</li>
<li>Does the Hare System satisfy the CWC, IIA and/or the Pareto properties?</li>
<li>What does the <em>Monotonicity Property</em> say?</li>
